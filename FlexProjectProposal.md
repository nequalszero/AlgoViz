## Algorithms Visualization

### Background

Not sure what I want to do for this project, but I was thinking of potentially
 a simple page for visualizing common algorithms like mergeSort, quickSort,
 BFS, DFS, etc.  Being that I'm not very comfortable with CSS and jQuery
timers, I think this would be a good project for practicing them.

### Functionality & MVP  

This algorithms visualization should:

- [ ] Be able to show the steps of a sorting algorithm like quick/mergeSort
- [ ] Animation of array elements
- [ ] Allow user to select algorithm to show
- [ ] ?

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An About modal describing the purpose of the application
- [ ] A production Readme

### Wireframes

I never look at wireframes, do I actually need to make one?

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript and `jquery` for overall structure and logic
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.


### Implementation Timeline

- Never really look at this section either, do I need it?
